    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3> Research </h3>
        <p> I am a researcher interested in Human-AI Cocreativity. I have conducted research in a variety of areas related to AI-supported creativity: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> AI-based Interactive Music Systems </li>
            <li> Gesture Recognition </li>
            <li> Conversational Agents </li>
            <li> Accessible Technology </li>
            <li> Prosthetics for Musical Performance </li>
            <li> AI-based Scene Generation </li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Teaching </h3>
        <p> My goal in teaching and research mentorship is to provide students with skills they can use in industry and interdisciplinary research with a constructionist, project-based approach. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> I encourage students to work together with others whose skills complement their own. </li>
        <li><b>Creativity:</b> I encourage students to work within the limitations of a course to develop projects they find useful to their research careers. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Biography </h3>
        <p>
            I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
            I work under Dr. Bryan Pardo at the Interactive Audio Lab in the Northwestern University Computer Science Department.
            I earned my BS in Music Engineering and Technology at the University of Miami in Miami, Florida in 2018.
            I earned my MS and Ph.D. in Music Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia in 2024.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div style="background-color: darkgray;">
            <h3> Gestural Recognition & Human-AI Interaction </h3>
                <p> To explore how human musicians perceive the AI components of systems they use to perform, I developed multiple AI-based Interactive Music Systems as part of my dissertation titled "Human-AI Partnerships in Gesture-Controlled Interactive Music Systems." </p>

            <h3> EarSketch </h3>
            <p> <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/">EarSketch</a> is an online learning environment for coding and music education that I contributed to as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Tech and Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University. I contributed to two research projects: </p>
            <h4> EarSketch CAI </h4>
            Georgia Tech and the University of Florida collaborated on research and development of an experiemental conversational agent, a Co-Creative AI (CAI), to support EarSketch users in writing code and music.
            <h4> Accessible EarSketch </h4>
            Georgia Tech, Northwestern University, and the University of North Texas have collaborated on multi-stage research in making EarSketch more accessible for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) learners.
